# Broken-line connectivity of open connected sets in the plane

Moise, *Geometric Topology in Dimensions 2 and 3*, Ch. 1: any two points of an open connected
subset of the plane are joined by a broken line (a finite polygonal chain of straight segments)
lying in the set.  This is the elementary input to the PL-approximation chapter (Thm 6.1); see
the docstrings of `ClassificationOfSurfaces/Moise/PLApproximation.lean` for the wider context.

`JoinedByBrokenLine U a b` records a chain of `n` segments inside `U` from `a` to `b`, as a
vertex list `v : Fin (n + 1) → Plane` whose consecutive closed segments all lie in `U`.  The
relation is reflexive (at points of `U`), symmetric, transitive, and monotone in `U`.

The main theorem `IsPreconnected.joinedByBrokenLine` is the standard clopen-chain argument:
for fixed `a`, both `{x ∈ U | JoinedByBrokenLine U a x}` and its complement in `U` are open,
because any metric ball inside `U` is convex, so the segment from a ball's centre to any of its
points extends or truncates a broken line by one segment.  Preconnectedness of `U` then forces
the complement to be empty.
