# Countermodels and semantic anchors

This file is the executable half of the Definition Faithfulness rules in
`docs/AUTOFORMALIZATION_GUIDE.md`.  It must stay in the default build target: if a definition is
weakened until junk witnesses satisfy it, something in this file stops compiling (or a negation
in this file becomes provable *and* its positive counterpart does too, which the trivial-closure
review catches).

Contents:

* positive anchor: the standard 2-simplex carries a geometric triangulation with one face;
* must-imply anchors are proved at the definition site
  (`GeometricTriangulation.compactSpace`, `GeometricTriangulation.t2Space`,
  `GeometricTriangulation.faces_nonempty`);
* non-examples: `ℝ` and `ℚ` admit no geometric triangulation;
* vacuity probes: empty face families and one-point vertex types cannot triangulate a nonempty
  space;
* an executable witness showing why the legacy triangulation/cell-presentation bridge remains in
  the weakness ledger;
* cell-complex non-examples: an unused dart orbit and disconnected face systems;
* a record of the vacuity failure of the retiring `SurfaceTriangulable` predicate, kept as
  documentation of why `GeometricTriangulation` replaces it (see `docs/KNOWN_WEAK.md`).

/-! ## Vacuity probes for geometric triangulations -/

/-- The empty-face strategy cannot triangulate a nonempty target. -/
example {S : Type*} [TopologicalSpace S] [Nonempty S] (T : GeometricTriangulation S) :
    T.faces ≠ ∅ :=
  Finset.nonempty_iff_ne_empty.mp T.faces_nonempty

/-- The `PUnit`/one-vertex junk strategy cannot supply a three-vertex geometric face for a
nonempty target. -/
example {S : Type*} [TopologicalSpace S] [Nonempty S] :
    ¬ ∃ (F : Finset (Finset (Fin 1))),
      (∀ t ∈ F, t.card = 3) ∧ Nonempty (GeometricRealization (Fin 1) F ≃ₜ S) := by
  rintro ⟨F, hF, ⟨h⟩⟩

  have hle : t.card ≤ Finset.univ.card :=
    Finset.card_le_card (Finset.subset_univ t)
  rw [hF t ht] at hle
  norm_num at hle

/-! ## Non-examples

A faithful notion of finite triangulation must fail for non-compact spaces.  The previous
`SurfaceTriangulable` predicate passed both of these with the empty triangulation. -/

example : ¬ Nonempty (GeometricTriangulation ℝ) := by
  rintro ⟨T⟩
  have hcompact := T.compactSpace
  exact not_compactSpace_iff.mpr inferInstance hcompact

  have hcompact := T.compactSpace
  exact not_compactSpace_iff.mpr inferInstance hcompact

/-! ## Legacy bridge countermodel

`FiniteSurfaceTriangulation` still has an arbitrary stored realization.  This fixture satisfies
its current validity record for every universe-0 topological space using `Homeomorph.refl`, while
its two face words are empty.  Consequently its cell presentation is neither incidence-valid nor
face-edge connected.  The faithful Radó theorem does not use this object as its conclusion; it
enters only through the explicitly ledgered compatibility bridge. -/

/-! ## Vacuity record

The legacy predicate `SurfaceTriangulable` was satisfied by **every** topological space via the
empty triangulation, because its `realization` field was arbitrary and unlinked to the
combinatorial data.  The predicate and the machine-checked vacuity proof were deleted together
(per the Definition Faithfulness rules); the proof is preserved in git history on the commit that
introduced this file.  If you find yourself able to write such a proof for
`GeometricTriangulation`, the definition has been broken. -/
