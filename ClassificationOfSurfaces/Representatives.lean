# Eval representatives and normal-form indices

The Lean-Eval challenge owns `Complex.ClosedUnitDisc`, `OrientableRel`, and
`NonOrientableRel`; they are imported verbatim from `LeanEval/ChallengeDeps.lean`. This file adds
only the project-owned sphere abbreviation and the index type used by the normal-form reduction.

/-- The normal forms that actually appear in the Lean Eval conclusion.

The orientable sphere is represented by the separate sphere branch, so an orientable polygonal
normal form must have a handle or a boundary component; nonorientable forms must have at least one
crosscap. -/
