# Weighted subdivisions of the circle

A positive list of integral weights determines the orientation-preserving piecewise-linear map
which sends the `i`th unit interval to an interval of length equal to the `i`th weight.  This file
packages that map as a homeomorphism of intervals and, after identifying endpoints, as a
homeomorphism of circles.  It is the geometric core of Gallier--Xu P1 edge subdivision.
